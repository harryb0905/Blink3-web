<h1>A progression from Blink3!</h1>

Moving now to HTML browser (soon to be displayable in a electron window for easy desktop use).

Interacts with [Blinksticks]('http://blinkstick.com') and allows for easy control of many presets.

Functionality is still very basic at the moment (two hours playing while I'm learning Flask!).

Soon to come more functions (and maybe even a database! ðŸ˜®)

Notes:
- No warranty
- Current prerequisites: Python 3, installing flask and blinkstick packages via pip
